## Luxolis Case

[Case Final Look](https://www.figma.com/file/YyNs6VBdwMUwdPdYUfXqXl/Login-Page-design-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-1&t=Rf3cWEMKXdqybI3y-0)

```bash
Please make the page responsive

Create a dummy hardcoded test account in the frontend - username: test@luxpmsoft.com / Password: test1234!

For the incorrect password, please show a pop-up window with a message, "the provided password is wrong"

Please only accept a combination of letters, numbers and special character. If the user does not provide the right combination of the password, please show an alert message right below the inputfield. The alert message should be "Wrong combination"
 
The login should only work with this account since there is no integration with the backend.

Leave the page after the login blank.
```

## Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev

yarn dev

pnpm dev

bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
